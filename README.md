The workshop on digital methods and resources is based on the material developed by Mats Malm (University of Gothenburg, Sweden). The workshop has been taught in spring terms 2017 and 2018. For the spring term 2019 the duration of the workshop has been reduced to a one-day event at the National Library of Norway. The focus is supposed to be on the (digital) collections of the National Library as well as other Norwegian and European collections.

I (@arockenberger) have been teaching a part of the digital methods workshop in spring term 2018, focusing on GLAM collection databases like Europeana â€“ and Wikidata. Following a lecture on databases (for humanities researchers) in general, students were introduced to querying the Wikidata API with SPARQL. The lecture part can be viewed on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/twIHRulpiG8). For the SPARQL lesson I followed the first part of the [SPARQL tutorial](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_tutorial) by @lucaswerkmeister of [Wikimedia Germany](https://wikimedia.de/).

For the spring term 2019 I have been asked to take over the general outline and content of the digital methods workshop. I will be revising the original content, syllabus and hands-on sessions provided by Mats Malm. I will develop the lesson material on GitHub, including slides for the lecture parts and additional material like Jupyter notebooks. The syllabus will be available via a [Zotero group library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2281494/ekul4000_spring2019).
